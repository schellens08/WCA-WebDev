        <p class="big-red-text"> If you drive while impaired, you could get arrested, or worse be involved in a traffic crash that causes serious injury or death. About 30% of all traffic crash fatalities in the United States involve drunk drivers (with BACs of . 08 g/dL or higher).</p>
       
        <p class="big-red-text">Five Possible Effects of an Overdose. </p>
<p class="big-red-text">What an individual experiences during an overdose depends on the substance they have used. While overdoses are common when someone takes too much of a particular drug, overdoses also occur when a person has taken more than one substance, and the interactions between the substances lead to unintended effects.</p>

<p class="big-red-text">Some immediate effects of an overdose include:</p>

<p class="big-red-text">1. Slowed Breathing</p>
<p class="big-red-text">Slowed breathing is one of the most common effects of an overdose. This can occur if someone has overdosed on opioids, alcohol, or other depressants. In some cases, breathing can slow to the point that it stops, which will prove fatal without medical intervention.</p>

<p class="big-red-text">2. Vomiting</p>
<p class="big-red-text">Vomiting is also a common overdose symptom, especially in the event of an alcohol overdose. This can be dangerous if the individual is alone during the overdose. In some cases, someone will vomit while asleep and choke without ever waking up.</p>

<p class="big-red-text">3. Seizures</p>
<p class="big-red-text">Seizures can occur as a result of a stimulant or alcohol overdose. A seizure can lead to injuries from striking body parts against the ground or other objects, but it can also result in other health issues like temporary confusion, loss of consciousness, severe headaches, and brain damage.</p>

<p class="big-red-text">4. Coma</p>
<p class="big-red-text">When enough oxygen cannot get to the brain, an overdose can cause a coma. Recovering from a coma can take a significant amount of time, as comas can lead to problems with memory, coordination, and communication. In some cases, those who are in comas due to an overdose never recover.</p>

<p class="big-red-text">5. Cardiac Arrest</p>
<p class="big-red-text">Cardiac arrest is a potentially fatal event that can also lead to lasting health issues if the person survives. If you see signs of cardiac arrest, like unexplained wheezing, chest pain, fainting, or lightheadedness, you should call 911 to ensure the person gets the immediate medical attention required. There are invisible side effects of cardiac arrest that can have fatal effects, so you should always make sure a doctor is involved with the recovery process.</p>

<p class="big-red-text">The Long-Term Effects of an Overdose</p>
<p class="big-red-text">While these short-term overdose effects are concerning, the long-term effects of an overdose can require attention as well. Even after the immediate danger has passed, an overdose can cause lasting psychological and physical damage. The mental health effects of an overdose can involve anxiety, depression, and memory problems, while physical effects can include Toxic Brain Injury, liver damage, compromised cardiovascular health, and neurological consequences.</p>
